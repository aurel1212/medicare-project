# Medicare, Part E

## Overview
Medicare is a health insurance program run by the United States federal government that covers tens of millions of Americans. As of 2010, there were approximately 48 million Americans covered by Medicare, most of them over the age of 65. In terms of costs, this translates to about 3% of the country's GDP. These figures are only expected to rise as more Americans reach retirement age and advancements in health care allow the elderly to live longer lives. 

Finding a mechanism to control costs, then, should be a clear imperative for the Medicaid program. This project aims to do that by, first, understanding factors that can be correlated with higher Medicare costs, then, creating a model to predict a  doctor's expected Medicare costs.
