# Medicare, Part E

## Overview
Medicare is a health insurance program run by the United States federal government that covers tens of millions of Americans. As of 2010, there were approximately 48 million Americans covered by Medicare, most of them over the age of 65. In terms of costs, this translates to about 3% of the country's GDP. These figures are only expected to rise as more Americans reach retirement age and advancements in health care allow the elderly to live longer lives. 

Finding a mechanism to control costs, then, should be a clear imperative for the Medicaid program. This project aims to do that by, first, understanding factors that can be correlated with higher Medicare costs, then, creating a model to predict a  doctor's expected Medicare costs. A model of this nature could be used for projecting future costs as well as to serve as a way to flag costs outside of some expected range.

## Data
Data were obtained for the calendar year 2013 from www.cms.gov. The data used includes the 'Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber' as well as the 'Physician and Other Supplier Data CY 2013'. Aggregated physician level files of these data were also used for certain demographic information. Data were also obtained from www.countyhealthrankings.org. This data mainly contained demographic type information.
